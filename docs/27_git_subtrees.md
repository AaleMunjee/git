## Git subtrees

Subtrees are a git tool for including the content of another repository as a dependency of your project. As an example, if you are working on a repository that would benefit from having the contents of another repository, subtrees might be the tool you need. Unlike submodules which require the use of a `.gitmodule` file to manage the inclusion of another repository in your repository, subtrees don't rely on external files to be managed.
