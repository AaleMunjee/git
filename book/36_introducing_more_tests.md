## Introduce More Tests

As you can see in the `tests/` directory, there are many more tests you can add to the `.yml` file. What do you think they do? What kind of tests would you write to ensure this game is working properly? If you aren't sure, the error message near the end of the code is a good indicator of what the test expects.

#### More changes to `.yml` file

Using the GitHub Flow that we've used throughout class, add more tests to the `.yml` file. (Note: You'll be able to commit these tests directly to the default branch if you haven't protected it!)

Feel free to use tests in the `tests/` directory, or if you'd like, write your own! If you do write your own, be sure that the error message is clear enough so that developers know how to fix what's broken.
