Emperor's clothes test: Are there ways in the organization that allow a novice (e.g., an intern) to publicly call attention to the emperor’s (i.e., the expert’s) lack of clothes (i.e., to raise quality issues), or does all internal communication addressed to a larger audience have to go through gatekeepers.

Need cultural and strategic alignment
Or else, pocket vetoes, shadow IT
