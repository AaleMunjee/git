# Tenets of InnerSource: Transparent

TRANSPARENT: Ensuring the process as well as the product is visible, predominantly by decoupling communications from time and space

Difference between Open and Transparent
- Restaurant analogy:
    - An open restaurant is inviting
    - But a transparent restaurant shows you how the sausage is made
    - Open is "showing", transparent is "knowing", a deeper level of sharing


Here’s the public mailing lists for the Apache Software Foundation

At GitHub we’ve largely replaced email with Issues, meaning any discussions related to a project are held in the open, are reference able via URLs, and searchable.

This helps create a wealth of knowledge around a project, avoiding tribal knowledge. You get documentation for free resulting from this way of communicating.

If your internal team is using a different platform to track issues or user stories for a project, such as Jira, repository issues can still be used as a form of internal team communications for things like meeting notes , scheduling (both for holiday requests and project timelines) , and other communications that normally occur within siloed email chains
