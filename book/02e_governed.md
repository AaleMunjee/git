# Tenets of InnerSource: Governed

GOVERNED: Directing, guiding, and supporting the software community, through standards, patterns, roles, and executive sponsorship

 - Directing, guiding, and supporting the software community, through standards, patterns, roles, and executive sponsorship
 - Governance across Open Source communities differ
 - Common: Established roles, earned through project contributions
 - Creating a community of learning and mentorship, where everyone is continually increasing their capabilities
 - InnerSource follows the same model, with the inclusion of executive sponsorship
