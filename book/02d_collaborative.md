collaboration around features (PR early and often), and across the company, creating awareness in downstream teams, creating a PR culture

This image is referred to as the “contributor funnel” 

In an Open Source project, the goal of an Open Source project owner is to increase the number of project maintainers , by creating a  welcoming environment for users to begin posting issues for reporting bugs , they can potentially see a user become invested in the project as a contributor , maybe with something small like a typo or grammatical edit to UI or documentation to potentially suggesting a feature or even more importantly suggesting a feature through a pull request and eventually becoming a maintainer of the project

Make it easy for someone to use your project. A friendly README and clear code examples will make it easier for anyone who lands on your project to get started.
Clearly explain how to contribute, using your CONTRIBUTING file and keeping your issues up-to-date.

At capital one, internal users were giving white-glove service as if they were a paying customer when reporting bugs / asking for features which saw a major uptick in # of contributors and eventual maintainers for the repository
