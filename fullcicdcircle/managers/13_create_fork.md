## Fork the Class Repository

To practice creating a pipeline, let's set up our own personal workspace. To create our workspace we will [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the class repository. A **fork** is effectively a copy of a project you can use to freely experiment without affecting the original project.

Although some organizations are still using the fork method to ensure security about what gets merged into the master branch, many organizations are beginning to use "protected branches" to minimize risk while merging pull requests.

1. Navigate to the class repository.
1. In the top-right-hand corner, click **Fork**.

1. You will then be taken to your forked repository where you can experiment. Notice the `forked from...` message in the top-left, and notice you can now see a **Settings** tab because you are the admin here.
