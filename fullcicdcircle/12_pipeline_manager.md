## Software Development Pipeline

GitHub concepts are well documented features, but it is important to understand how developers do their work. Even new users to GitHub can set up a CI/CD development pipeline with little effort.

A pipeline is a concept of how your tools fit together, so the development process is seamless. The goals are to:
- Provide quick feedback to developers
- Automate as much as possible
- Deploy with higher quality code

These three smaller goals all fit together to accomplish a much larger and more abstract goal: to develop faster and better.

### What tools do you use?

What tools are already in use in your organization? What tools have been used in the past, or may be used in the future? GitHub provides a centralized "Hub" where all of these tools can be connected so developers can see all of the important puzzle pieces connected where they're working.
