## Day 2 Activities

### Merge Conflict Practice

Depending on how you're interacting with this manual, you may be in a class. The instructor may have set up a repository for you to practice merge conflicts. If this is the case:
- _Every person_ has their own repository. Each person should fix the merge conflicts in their own repo. It will be called `github.com/githubschool/conflict-practice-username`, with username being your actual username.
- We won't make you turn in your homework, but we will run a script to see if the activities are completed later. :wink:

### Work to resolve the merge conflicts in the conflicts repository.
1. Find your repository. It will be at `github.com/githubschool/USERNAME`, where your username is replacing the word USERNAME.
1. In your repository, navigate to the **Pull Requests** tab.
1. There are three open pull requests, and all of them have merge conflicts to fix. We recommend fixing them in this order:
  - Update README
  - Updates to game manual
  - Minor CSS fixes
1. View the pull request, and follow the steps to resolve the merge conflicts. When the merge conflict is resolved, merge the pull request.
