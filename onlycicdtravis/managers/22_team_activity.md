## Real World Team Work

Now, we're going to divide into small teams of 2-3 people. Each team will be create a workflow scenario, then shape a possible pipeline to help the team while fitting into the team's given restrictions.

Each team might want to use some of the scenarios from the previous section, but please feel encouraged to shape a story that maps most closely to how you work on a daily basis.


### Team Activity Part 1: Create a scenario
1. Write out the problem in an issue in the class repository. This can include general statements, specific technical limitations or needs, imagined user testimonies, and whatever else you think will paint a detailed picture. Be as specific as possible, noting existing technologies, team size, and end goals.
2. Discuss (and document within the issue) the following questions as they pertain to your chosen example. These should start from a "what we DID have" perspective.
  - Do you have examples of the types of repositories you have?
  - What tooling is used outside of version control?
  - What is the regulation or auditing process like?
  - How many repositories and developers are currently involved?
  - How many developers are on each team?
  - How closely do development teams work with other teams, like infrastructure, dev-ops, QA, etc?

### Team Activity Part 2: Brainstorm solutions
1. Reflect on the process, and prepare to advise. Based on the first part of the activity, brainstorm possible solutions that could address the concerns of the group. Some questions that might help with concrete decisions include:
  - How many organization accounts should you have? How many do you have?
  - How do you decide when to create a new repository?
  - What GitHub features would you want to heavily utilize?
  - What administrative settings could be arranged to be helpful?
  - How is this change a part of a bigger picture in process and platform improvement?
  - How will culture be affected by software changes?
2. What GitHub settings will make sense for this group? Consider if they have the ability to change multiple tools, or if they only have the ability to make small changes at a time. Some potential GitHub tools to consider are
  - GitHub Pages
  - Git Flow vs GitHub Flow
  - Choosing tools in the development pipeline
  - Project Boards &  Milestones
  - Templates
  - Avoiding context changing
  - Using Pulse and Graphs
  - Protected branches
  - Avoiding duplicated code and work
3. Keep in mind which tooling would make the most sense for the given scenario. Document the broad picture for a workflow for a team, including their needs for project management, continuous integration, and deployment.

### Team Activity Part 3: Map it all out

Use markdown in pull requests as well as drawing on whiteboards or large paper to map out the workflow solution your team has created. Create this resource in a way that it could be used to reference by other team leads and developers, and shared within the company to answer questions. It's OK if it's not a full and perfect solution, but acknowledging what questions aren't answered within the context of the larger workflow is generally a good idea. Include branching diagrams and deployment/release strategies.

We will share these completed scenarios from start to finish as a group.
