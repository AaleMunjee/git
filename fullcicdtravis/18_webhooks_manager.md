## Webhooks on GitHub

Check out the new Webhook created in your GitHub repository. [Webhooks are a powerful tool for streamlining your development pipeline](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/), and allow you to build or set up GitHub Apps which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. GitHub Apps and integrations use Webhooks, but individual developers and teams can also use Webhooks to customize their workflow.

1. Go to the repository's **Settings** tab, then select **Webhooks** to see that it was automatically created when you authorized it.
