## Reviewing the Pipeline

Let's take some time to discuss what we've covered so far.

### Software development pipeline
We discussed the GitHub flow, and worked together on a project from start to finish. This means the project went from planning stages, through creating code, into having tests run (and pass), and finally deploying to a live site.

### Avoiding context switching
Developers drive progress, and switching between many tools takes away valuable time and focus from the real work. Integrating all parts of the pipeline into one platform allows developers to avoid switching context and keep their focus centered.

### Automation when possible
Many of the pieces of the pipeline are automated - as many as possible. Though this requires up-front work to set up the automation, it saves an abundance of time and minimizes mistakes that could easily be made if done manually.
