## Goals for this course

During our time together, we are going to discuss common workflows on GitHub with hands on walkthroughs of industry software development pipelines from start to finish. GitHub is the platform which connects all of the important tools in your software development lifecycle. We will:

- Discuss and dissect different workflows
- Explore software development past version control
- Hands on activities and Workflows
- Create a full pipeline, and design future pipelines
- Create, discuss, and problem solve with different workflow challenges
- Practice mapping workflows

By the end of this course, you'll see that GitHub goes far beyond version control.
